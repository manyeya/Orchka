# Execution Monitoring

Orchka provide a powerful set of tools to monitor your workflow executions in real-time and review historical runs.

## Execution History

The **Executions** page provides a comprehensive list of all workflow runs. You can filter executions by status (Success, Failed, Running) and search for specific runs.

Each entry in the execution history shows:
- **Status**: The current state of the execution.
- **Workflow**: The name of the workflow that was executed.
- **Started At**: When the execution began.
- **Duration**: Total time taken for the execution.

## Execution Detail View

Clicking on an execution entry opens the **Execution Detail View**. This view is designed to provide deep visibility into what happened during a specific run.

### Trace Timeline

The execution detail features a D3-powered **Trace Timeline**. This visualization maps out every step of the workflow against a horizontal time axis.

- **Step Visualization**: Each node execution is represented as a segment on the timeline.
- **Duration Mapping**: The length of each segment corresponds to the time it took for that specific node to execute.
- **Relative Positioning**: Quickly identify bottlenecks by seeing which steps took the longest or where delays occurred between steps.

### Status Indicators

Each step in the trace is color-coded based on its outcome:
- <span style={{ color: 'var(--success)' }}>●</span> **Success**: The node completed successfully.
- <span style={{ color: 'var(--destructive)' }}>●</span> **Failed**: The node encountered an error.
- <span style={{ color: 'var(--muted-foreground)' }}>●</span> **Pending/Running**: The node is currently executing or waiting.

## Data Inspection

Deeply inspect the data flowing through your workflow with the integrated **Payload Viewer**.

### Payload Viewer

Located within the Execution Detail view, the Payload Viewer uses a premium, searchable JSON tree structure to display:
- **Input**: The exact data passed to the node.
- **Output**: The result produced by the node.
- **Error Details**: If a node fails, the full error message and stack trace (if available) are shown.

### Features
- **Collapsible Nodes**: Navigate large JSON structures easily.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Type-safe and readable data representation.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Keep track of where you are in complex objects.

## Real-time Updates

When you execute a workflow from the editor, the monitoring system provides live feedback:
- **Live Trace**: Watch nodes light up on the canvas and appear in the trace timeline as they execute.
- **Instant Logs**: View logs and data as soon as they are generated by the backend.

## Error Recovery

If an execution fails, Orchka's monitoring tools help you identify the root cause quickly:
1. Locate the red failed step in the **Trace Timeline**.
2. Select the step to view its **Error Payload**.
3. Fix the configuration in the editor and **Re-execute**.
