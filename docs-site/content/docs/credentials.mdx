# Credentials

Orchka provides a secure credential management system for storing and using API keys, tokens, and authentication details in your workflows.

## Overview

Instead of hardcoding sensitive values in your workflow nodes, you can:

1. Store credentials securely with AES-256-GCM encryption
2. Reference credentials by ID in your nodes
3. Credentials are decrypted only during workflow execution

## Credential Types

| Type | Fields | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| **API Key** | `apiKey` | Generic API authentication |
| **Basic Auth** | `username`, `password` | HTTP Basic authentication |
| **Bearer Token** | `token` | OAuth/JWT bearer tokens |
| **OAuth2** | `clientId`, `clientSecret`, `accessToken`, `refreshToken` | OAuth2 flows |
| **OpenAI** | `apiKey`, `organization` (optional) | OpenAI API |
| **Anthropic** | `apiKey` | Anthropic Claude API |
| **Google AI** | `apiKey` | Google Gemini API |

## Creating Credentials

1. Navigate to **Credentials** in the dashboard sidebar
2. Click **New Credential**
3. Select the credential type
4. Enter a unique name and the required fields
5. Click **Create**

## Using Credentials in Nodes

### AI Agent Node

Select a stored credential instead of relying on environment variables:

1. Open the AI Agent node settings
2. In the **Credential** dropdown, select your saved credential
3. The credential type must match the selected model provider

```yaml
Model: gpt-4o
Credential: My OpenAI Key (OpenAI type)
```

### HTTP Request Node

Use credentials for API authentication:

1. Open the HTTP Request node settings
2. Set **Auth Type** to "Credential"
3. Select the appropriate credential

Supported credential types for HTTP:
- **Bearer Token** → `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Basic Auth** → `Authorization: Basic <base64>`
- **API Key** → `X-API-Key: <key>`

## Testing Credentials

Before using a credential in production:

1. Open the credential details
2. Click **Test Credential**
3. For AI provider credentials, this validates the API key with the provider

## Security

- Credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Decryption only occurs during workflow execution
- Credential data is never exposed in API responses (only metadata)
- Audit logs track credential access during workflow runs

### Environment Setup

Generate an encryption key for your deployment:

```bash
# Generate a 32-byte hex key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Add to your `.env`:

```bash
CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_hex_key_here
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names** - "Production OpenAI" vs "test-key-1"
2. **Rotate credentials regularly** - Update credentials without changing workflows
3. **Test before deploying** - Use the test feature to validate credentials
4. **One credential per purpose** - Easier to track and rotate
