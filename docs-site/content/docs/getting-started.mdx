# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through creating your first workflow in Orchka.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A running Orchka instance
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Safari recommended)

## Creating Your First Workflow

### Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Navigate to the Orchka dashboard. You'll see a list of your existing workflows (if any) and a button to create new ones.

### Step 2: Create a New Workflow

Click the **"New Workflow"** button. This will:

1. Generate a unique workflow with a random name
2. Redirect you to the workflow editor
3. Add a default **Manual Trigger** node to the canvas

### Step 3: Understanding the Editor

The workflow editor consists of:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Canvas** | The main drag-and-drop area where you build your workflow |
| **Sidebar** | Contains all available nodes organized by category |
| **Toolbar** | Execute, save, and manage your workflow |
| **Settings Panel** | Configure the selected node |

### Step 4: Add Your First Action Node

1. Open the node palette by clicking the **+** button or looking at the left panel
2. Browse the available categories:
   - **Triggers** - Start points for workflows
   - **Actions** - Perform operations (HTTP requests, AI agents, etc.)
   - **Control** - Flow control (conditions, loops, waits)
3. Click on a node to add it to the canvas

### Step 5: Connect Nodes

Drag from the **output handle** (right side) of one node to the **input handle** (left side) of another to create a connection.

```
[Manual Trigger] ──→ [HTTP Request] ──→ [AI Agent]
```

### Step 6: Configure Nodes

Click on any node to open its settings panel:

- **HTTP Request**: Set the URL, method, headers, and body
- **AI Agent**: Configure the AI model and available tools
- **Condition**: Define the expression to evaluate

### Step 7: Execute Your Workflow

### Step 8: Monitor Execution

Once the workflow starts, you can monitor its progress in detail:

1. Click the **"Execution History"** tab or icon.
2. View the **Trace Timeline** to see the timing and status of each node.
3. Select any node in the trace to inspect its **Input and Output** payloads.

For more details on monitoring, see the [Execution Monitoring](/docs/executions) guide.
