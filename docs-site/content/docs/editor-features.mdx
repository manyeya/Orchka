# Editor Features

The Orchka Editor has been enhanced with new tools and visual improvements to help you organize and build simpler, cleaner workflows.

## Canvas & Visualization

### Step Connections
The editor now uses **Step edges** (orthogonal lines) by default. This creates clean, right-angled connections between nodes, making complex workflows easier to read and follow compared to curved Bezier lines.

### Improved Grid
The canvas features a refined dot pattern grid to help you align nodes precisely.

## Node Palette

The **Node Palette** is now a dedicated, resizable panel on the left side of the editor (or accessible via the generic "Add Node" button).

- **Search**: Quickly find nodes by name or category.
- **Categories**: Nodes are organized into Triggers, Actions, and Control logic.
- **Drag & Drop**: You can drag nodes directly from the palette onto the canvas.

## Organization Tools

### Group Nodes
Keep your workflow organized by grouping related nodes together.

- **Grouping**: Drag a `Group Node` onto the canvas and resize it to encompass other nodes.
- **Movement**: Moving a Group Node automatically moves all the nodes inside it, making it easy to rearrange sections of your workflow.
- **Ungrouping**: You can drag nodes out of a group to detach them.

### Annotation Nodes (Sticky Notes)
Add context and documentation directly to your workflow using **Annotation Nodes**.

- **text**: Add titles and descriptions to explain complex logic.
- **Visuals**: Place them anywhere on the canvas to label sections or leave TODOs for your team.
