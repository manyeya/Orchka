# Editor Features

The Orchka Editor has been enhanced with new tools and visual improvements to help you organize and build simpler, cleaner workflows.

## Canvas & Visualization

### Step Connections
The editor now uses **Step edges** (orthogonal lines) by default. This creates clean, right-angled connections between nodes, making complex workflows easier to read and follow compared to curved Bezier lines.

### Improved Grid
The canvas features a refined dot pattern grid to help you align nodes precisely.

## Node Palette

The **Node Palette** is now a dedicated, resizable panel on the left side of the editor (or accessible via the generic "Add Node" button).

- **Search**: Quickly find nodes by name or category.
- **Categories**: Nodes are organized into Triggers, Actions, and Control logic.
- **Drag & Drop**: You can drag nodes directly from the palette onto the canvas.

## Organization Tools

### Group Nodes
Keep your workflow organized by grouping related nodes together.

- **Grouping**: Drag a `Group Node` from the palette onto the canvas and resize it to encompass other nodes.
- **Magnetic Movement**: Moving a Group Node automatically moves all the nodes contained within its boundaries. This allows you to rearrange entire workflow sections effortlessly.
- **Ungrouping**: Simply drag a node out of the group's boundary to detach it. Deleting a group node will leave its child nodes on the canvas, preserving your work.
- **Customization**: Group nodes can be colored and labeled to provide visual cues for different workflow segments.

### Annotation Nodes (Sticky Notes)
Add context and documentation directly to your workflow using **Annotation Nodes**.

- **Rich Text**: Add titles and detailed descriptions to explain complex logic or document design decisions.
- **Visual Clarity**: Use annotations to label sections, leave TODOs, or provide instructions for other team members.
- **Flexible Styling**: Choose from multiple color themes (Yellow, Blue, Green, Pink) to categorize your notes or highlight critical information.
- **Persistence**: Annotations are saved with your workflow and remain exactly where you placed them.
